    "# What is an API?\n",
    "APIs, or Application Programming Interfaces, are useful to anyone who wants to access and use data or services that are provided by other applications or systems. APIs set a standard way for different applications and systems to communicate and share data with each other. This way, we don't have to build every app or dataset from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs are the bread and butter of data collection. There's tons of APIs that we, as programmers, can access to gather data to create new datasets for analysis or create apps. Some examples of useful APIs are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Twitter API: This API allows you to collect data from Twitter, including tweets, user profiles, and search results. This could be useful for social media analysis, sentiment analysis, and trend analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. OpenAI API: This API allows you to provide text input to the API and receive back a variety of responses, such as generated text, summarized text, or translated text. This allows you to leverage the powerful ChatGPT and other OpenAI models programmatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. NASA API: This API allows you to access data from NASA's various missions and programs, including images, videos, and scientific data. This could be useful for space exploration, scientific research, and educational applications."

    "## Example of Using the Twitter API for Social Psychology Research\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose a psychologist wants to study how social outrage affects mental health.\n",
    "To do this, they could use the Twitter API to collect tweets related to a recent social outrage event, such as a controversial political decision or a high-profile court case. They could then analyze the language used in these tweets to determine the level of outrage expressed by the users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how the psychologist could use the Twitter API to collect the tweets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, they would need to apply for a Twitter Developer account and create a new Twitter app.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. They would then need to use the Twitter API to search for tweets containing keywords related to the social outrage event. For example, they could search for tweets containing a specific hashtag or the names of people involved in the controversial decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Once they have collected the tweets, they could use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the language used in the tweets. For example, they could use sentiment analysis to determine the overall sentiment of the tweets (positive, negative, or neutral), or they could use topic modeling to identify the key themes and topics discussed in the tweets.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Finally, they could use statistical analysis to explore the relationship between the level of outrage expressed in the tweets and measures of mental health, such as self-reported stress or depression."

    "## API Calls are like Phone Calls\n",
    "\n",
    "When we work with another organization's API to get data or use a service they provide, we say we're making an API Call.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we make an API call there's 4 important components to keep in mind: Your program making the call, the request your program makes, the Server that answers the call, and the response object they send back.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Your program making the call: This is like you picking up the phone and dialing a phone number to call a friend. In the context of an API call, your program is the code that initiates the call and sends the request to the API server.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The request your program makes: This is like the message that you leave on your friend's voicemail asking for information. In the context of an API call, the request is the message that your program sends to the API server asking for data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The Server that answers the call: This is like your friend listening to your voicemail and gathering the information you requested. In the context of an API call, the server is the computer that receives your request, processes it, and sends back a response with the data you requested.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The response object they send back: This is like your friend calling you back and telling you the information that you asked for. In the context of an API call, the response is the message that the server sends back to your program with the data you requested."
